# 👋 Hi, I'm Harsha Jaiganesh

> 🧠 **AI Engineer & Workflow Automation Enthusiast**

Welcome to my playground for building intelligent systems that blend large language models (LLMs) with real-world utility! 🚀

I specialize in crafting advanced generative AI pipelines that transform raw data into actionable insights—whether it's:
- 🌐 Scraping the web
- 📝 Summarizing meetings
- 🤖 Building responsive chatbots
- 📄 Enabling smart document retrieval

This repository is a showcase of interactive Jupyter notebooks designed to highlight the most powerful and practical generative AI workflows today. Dive in to explore:
- ⚡ Real-time streaming responses
- 🧩 Prompt engineering
- 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- 🔊 Audio transcription pipelines

Whether you're a developer, researcher, or just curious about LLMs in action, this repo offers hands-on insights into the engineering behind applied generative AI. Let's build the future of intelligent automation together! ✨
