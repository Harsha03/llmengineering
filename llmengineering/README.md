[llmwebscraper.ipynb] is an interactive Jupyter notebook that showcases the use of generative AI to automate the creation of company brochures. It uses OpenAI's API to analyze scraped website content and relevant links, then generates entertaining, informative, and markdown-formatted brochures tailored for customers, investors, and recruits. The notebook demonstrates prompt engineering, LLM-driven content synthesis, and real-time streaming of AI-generated text, making it a practical guide for building advanced GenAI-powered web automation workflows.
