# LLM Engineering

[llmwebscraper.ipynb] is an interactive Jupyter notebook that showcases the use of generative AI to automate the creation of company brochures. It uses OpenAI's API to analyze scraped website content and relevant links, then generates entertaining, informative, and markdown-formatted brochures tailored for customers, investors, and recruits. The notebook demonstrates prompt engineering, LLM-driven content synthesis, and real-time streaming of AI-generated text, making it a practical guide for building advanced GenAI-powered web automation workflows.

[llmchatbot.ipynb] is an interactive notebook that demonstrates how to build a multi-model AI chatbot using Gradio. It streams responses from OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini, allowing users to select the model and interact in real time. The notebook highlights prompt engineering, streaming LLM outputs, and user-friendly web interfaces for advanced conversational AI applications.
[llmknowledgeworker.ipynb] is an interactive notebook that demonstrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain and Chroma. It loads and splits documents from a local knowledge base, creates vector embeddings with OpenAI, and stores them in a Chroma vector database. The notebook builds a conversational retrieval chain with LangChain, enabling users to query the knowledge base using an LLM and receive contextually relevant answers. It also features a Gradio chat interface for real-time interaction with the RAG-powered assistant.
